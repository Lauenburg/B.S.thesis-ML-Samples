# MachineLearning
Collection of my machine learning projects

The folders "Autoencoder" and "Classifier" are comprised of mainly Convolutional Neural Networks 
implemented with Python using the Keras framework. I acquired the sample data by monitoring the energy 
consumption characteristics of an eDo robot arm via a high-resolution energy monitoring system, which I co-engineered.

Six distinct movements constitute the data, each of the motions using one of the eDo's six degrees of freedom.
